# Welcome to my portfolio!

Or, rather, this is more of a collection of a portion of my work! I haven't picked ALL of my art haha, but I hope what I have picked will help in everything the zine mods are looking for in terms of judging my art for the purpose of the zine.

You can download this portfolio directly by clicking [here](https://github.com/MijumewAndCo/portfolio/archive/refs/tags/portfolio.zip)! I recommend it, since browsing images on GitHub is not the most convenient.

This portfolio has art divided in four folders:

* digital-colored-illustration: This is the folder with the most stuff in it, it holds several illustrations I made over the years which I think encompass my style well enough. In this folder only, drawings are sorted by created date. Note that, if the lineart looks choppy in some of them, that's because I like drawing and inking the lineart traditionally before moving on to digital drawings! If I get chosen as one of the artists for the zine, I will do my lineart digitally, so this will not be an issue.
* ghosttrick-pencil-sketches: A few pencil sketches of some Ghost Trick characters, mostly Sissel! I admittedly haven't drawn much Ghost Trick art, so I figured I'd add these in to give you a better idea of how I draw these characters. PLEASE NOTE: despite what I said, my Ghost Trick art style and my Ace Attorney art style are pretty similar, so you can cross-reference between them in this portfolio. (I draw child characters similarly to how I draw the chibis in this portfolio.)
* merch: Some example of merch I made for myself and others, including their digital mockups as reference. (Fun fact: the stickers are hand-made! Printed digital drawings + tape + baking sheets!)
* zz-bonus: A little something I thought you'd enjoy c:

Hope you like this! Thanks for your work!
