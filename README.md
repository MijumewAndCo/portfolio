# Welcome to my portfolio!

Or, rather, this is more of a collection of a portion of my work! I haven't picked ALL of my art haha, but I hope what I have picked will help in everything the zine mods are looking for in terms of judging my art for the purpose of the zine.

You can download this portfolio directly by clicking [here](https://github.com/MijumewAndCo/portfolio/archive/refs/tags/portfolio.zip)! I recommend it, since browsing images on GitHub is not the most convenient.
